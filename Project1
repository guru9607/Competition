                    In recent years, cryptocurrency—and in particular, Bitcoin—has demonstrated its value, now boasting 14 million
                    Bitcoins
                    in circulation. Investors speculating in the future possibilities of this new technology have driven most of the
                    current
                    market capitalization, and this is likely to remain the case until a certain measure of price stability and
                    market
                    acceptance is achieved. Apart from the declared price of cryptocurrency, those invested in it appear to be
                    relying on a
                    perceived “inherent value” of cryptocurrency. This includes the technology and network itself, the integrity of
                    the
                    cryptographic code and the decentralized network <br><br>

                    variety of
                    transactions, in addition to the traditional payments system. These include stocks, bonds and other financial
                    assets for
                    which records are stored digitally and for which currently there is a need for a trusted third party to provide

                    The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable. Today,
                    there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. Some of these are clones or
                    forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch.

                    there were over 18.8 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $858.9 billion, with the figure
                    updating frequently. Only 21 million bitcoins exist, preventing both inflation and manipulation.

                    existence is over $1.8 trillion—Bitcoin currently represents approximately 46.5% of the total value.
